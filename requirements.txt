1. End-User Requirements (Using the Live App)
>To use the deployed web application, a person only needs:

A Modern Web Browser
>Any up-to-date browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge that supports modern JavaScript.

An Internet Connection
>To access the web page and for the app to communicate with the backend API.

2. Deployment Environment Requirements (For Hosting)
>To host and run the application (for example, on Vercel), you need:

A Vercel Account (or a similar serverless hosting platform)
>The project is designed to be deployed as a serverless application.

**Google Gemini API Key**
>This is the most critical requirement. You must have a valid API key from Google AI Studio.

Environment Variable Configuration
>The hosting environment must be configured with an environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY containing your API key. This is crucial for the backend to make authenticated requests to the Gemini API.

3. Developer Requirements (To Run or Modify Locally)
>If you want to clone the project and modify it on your local machine, you will need:

Git
>To clone the repository from its source.

A Code Editor
>Such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or any other editor for modifying HTML and JavaScript files.

A Local Web Server
>To serve the index.html file so that the browser can properly handle API requests. You can use simple tools like the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.

Vercel CLI (Optional)
>If you want to test the serverless function locally before deploying, installing the Vercel CLI is the best way to replicate the production environment.

A .env file
>In the project's root directory, you would need a .env file containing your GEMINI_API_KEY for the Vercel CLI to use for local testing. This file is correctly ignored by Git to prevent accidentally sharing your key.
